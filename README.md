# Simple program Editor
A simple program editor with basic logic gates.

Make a computer program!
- Drag logic gates in from the side.
- `Click and drag` from a node on an input gate to another gate to connect them.
- `Click and drag` on the canvas or control click to select multiple gates.
- Press `space` hovering over input bits to change their value.
- Delete a gate by dragging it to the right hand side, or by selecting it and pressing `delete`.
- Create new gates by pressing the create button, and naming the gate and specifying the colour.
- The colour of the LEDs can be cycled by pressing the `space bar`.
- Press `control and S` to save. The same thing can be done by clicking on the respective button.
- `Left click` on a wire to delete.

Based on a [video series](https://youtu.be/QZwneRb-zqA?feature=shared) by Sebastian Lague. Just wanted to see what it will look like in JavaScript. 
I'm planning to add more stuff like a gate filter in the future. Might also be cool to have a pre-built binary - base 10 system. SR latches still aren't supported.
