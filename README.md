# Simple program Editor
A simple program editor with basic logic gates.

Make a computer program!
- Drag logic gates in from the side
- Click and drag from a node on an input gate to another gate to connect them.
- Press space hovering over input bits to change their value.
- Delete a gate by dragging it to the side.

Based on a [video series](https://youtu.be/QZwneRb-zqA?feature=shared) by Sebastian Lague. Just wanted to see what it will look like in JavaScript. 
It currently supports multiple inputs and outputs, but there still isn't a way to make custom gates. 
The custom gate currently outputs the respective value for an "AND" gate in the first output and an "OR" gate in the second.

Not sure if this is turing complete (yet), but working on it.
