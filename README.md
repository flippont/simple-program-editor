# Simple program Editor
A simple program editor with basic logic gates.

Make a computer program!
- Drag logic gates in from the side
- Right click and drag from an input gate to another gate to connect them.
- Press space hovering over input bits to change their value.

Not sure if this is turing complete (yet), but working on it. 

Next step is adding an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs that you can edit.
