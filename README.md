# Simple program Editor
A simple program editor with basic logic gates.

Make a computer program!
- Drag logic gates in from the side.
- Click and drag from a node on an input gate to another gate to connect them.
- Click and drag on the canvas or control click to select multiple gates.
- Press space hovering over input bits to change their value.
- Delete a gate by dragging it to the right hand side, or by selecting it and pressing delete.
- Create new gates by pressing the create button, and naming the gate and specifying the colour.
- The colour of the LEDs can be cycled by pressing the space bar.

Based on a [video series](https://youtu.be/QZwneRb-zqA?feature=shared) by Sebastian Lague. Just wanted to see what it will look like in JavaScript. 
I'm planning to add more stuff like a gate filter and a better wiring system in the future.

Not sure if this is turing complete (yet), but working on it.
